Trying out PHP. I come from Python and some React so it would be interesting to have a different perspective.


# Goals
- Understand the basics
- See the strengths and weaknesses of PHP
- Try different practices and find what suites me
- Play with OOP a bit
- Be able to understand when to and use PHP for a real project


## Day 1
Was not on github, wrote a hello world

## Day 2 (current day)
- Used AI to get a brief intro into the language and how they are structured and function.
- Installed `composer` and initiated a project.
- Created `Model/Post.php` and `Repository/PostRepository.php`.
- added semi-auth thing
Importing an `.html` file directly seems strange, probably not a good practice.
